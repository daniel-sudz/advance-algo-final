    Finds a valid Set on a board 

    A card is represented by a number[p][v] telling if a value is present (1) or not (0) for every property.

    @param cards_on_board: a list of cards that are currently on the board (number[][][])
    @param num_properties: the total number of properties for each card (number)

    @returns number[]: a binary list of whether a card at index from cards_on_board is part of the solution or not
                       may return empty list if no solution is found
