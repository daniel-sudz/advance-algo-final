    Citation: I generalized the mathmatical formulation here (https://tommyodland.com/articles/2019/the-card-game-set-as-a-binary-integer-program/).
    into a parameterized model (the source hardcoded p=4 and v=3 see writeup for notation). The MIP library was used for implementation.

    Finds a valid Set on a board 

    A card is represented by a number[p][v] telling if a value is present (1) or not (0) for every property.

    @param cards_on_board: a list of cards that are currently on the board (number[][][])
    @param num_properties: the total number of properties for each card (number)

    @returns number[]: a binary list of whether a card at index from cards_on_board is part of the solution or not
                       may return empty list if no solution is found
